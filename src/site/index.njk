        <p>
          I love <strong>breaking down problems</strong> to their core to build
          <strong>thoughtful, scalable, and accessible</strong> solutions with users at heart.
          Whatâ€™s more, I believe in learning + building with other disciplines to make what we do
          <strong>smarter, more informed, and&nbsp;resilient</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contribute across the stack, enjoy digging into build tools, and believe in adopting the
          right tools for the job&mdash;with a healthy use of web standards, of&nbsp;course.
